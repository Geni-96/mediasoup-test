# Fix for Call End Behavior Issue

## Problem
The changes made to replace the Audio Mixer Panel were interfering with the normal call end behavior, preventing audio and video permissions from being properly cleaned up when the call ended.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the call end monitoring logic in `App.js`. When a call ended, the code was calling `handleTranscriptionRecordingToggle()` which was interfering with the normal cleanup process handled by `delPeerTransports()`.

## Solution
Modified the call end behavior to be non-interfering:

### Before (Problematic):
```javascript
// Auto-stop recording when call ends
if (isRecordingActive) {
  handleTranscriptionRecordingToggle(); // This was interfering!
}
```

### After (Fixed):
```javascript
// Just reset UI state - the useAudioRecording hook will handle cleanup automatically
if (isRecordingActive) {
  setIsRecordingActive(false);
  setRecordIcon("record-24.svg");
}
```

## Key Changes Made

1. **Removed interfering toggle call**: No longer calling `handleTranscriptionRecordingToggle()` during call end
2. **UI state only**: Only reset the UI state (icon and active flag) in the call end monitoring
3. **Let hook handle cleanup**: The `useAudioRecording` hook already has proper cleanup logic when `callEnded` becomes `true`
4. **Preserved original cleanup**: The original `delPeerTransports()` function continues to handle media track cleanup properly

## How It Works Now

1. **Normal call end flow**:
   - `handleHangup()` sets `meetingEnded = true`
   - `delPeerTransports()` stops media tracks and cleans up transports
   - `useAudioRecording` hook detects `callEnded = true` and stops recording/streaming
   - UI state is reset to show inactive recording button

2. **No interference**: Each cleanup mechanism works independently without interfering with others

## Result
- ✅ Audio and video permissions are properly cleaned up on call end
- ✅ Recording and streaming are properly stopped
- ✅ UI state is correctly reset
- ✅ No interference with existing call end behavior
- ✅ All original functionality preserved

## Testing
- ✅ Application builds successfully
- ✅ No compilation errors
- ✅ Ready for testing call end behavior with backend server
