# Speaker Diarization Logs

This directory contains speaker activity logs generated by the MediaSoup AudioLevelObserver.

## File Format

Speaker log files are generated in JSON format with the following structure:

```json
{
  "roomId": "string",        // Room identifier
  "sessionId": "string",     // Session identifier
  "timestamp": "string",     // ISO timestamp when log was written
  "speakers": [              // Array of speaking events
    {
      "user": "string",      // Participant username
      "start": "number",     // Start time in seconds
      "end": "number"        // End time in seconds
    }
  ]
}
```

## File Naming Convention

- `speaker-log-{roomId}.json` - Room-based speaker log
- `speaker-log-{sessionId}.json` - Session-based speaker log

## Usage

These logs are generated automatically by the server-side MediaSoup AudioLevelObserver and are ready for consumption by transcription services. The logs contain accurate timing information for when each participant spoke during the meeting.

## Cleanup

Log files persist until consumed by transcription services or manually cleaned up. Consider implementing a cleanup routine for old log files.
